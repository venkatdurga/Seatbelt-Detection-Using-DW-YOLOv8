# Images Folder - Seat Belt Detection Project

This folder contains a collection of images used for various purposes throughout the Seat Belt Detection project. These images range from model architecture diagrams to example images showing detection results and cropped regions used for YOLO model inference. Below is an overview of each file contained in this folder:

## Folder Structure and Files

### *Model and Architecture Images*

1. *DWconv (1).jpeg*  
   - *Description*: This image illustrates the architecture for the Depth-Wise Convolution (DWConv) approach used in YOLOv8. Depth-wise convolutions are utilized to reduce model size and increase computational efficiency, especially for real-time applications.

2. *customyolov8 (1).jpeg*  
   - *Description*: The modified YOLOv8 architecture used for the Seat Belt Detection project, incorporating specific changes to optimize detection performance for seat belts in automotive settings.

3. *yolov5_arch (1).jpeg*  
   - *Description*: Diagram illustrating the default YOLOv5 architecture, which serves as a baseline for comparison with the YOLOv8 architecture in this project.

4. *yolov8-arch (1).jpeg*  
   - *Description*: Diagram showing the default YOLOv8 architecture, which is modified for the specific detection task in this project.

### *Detection and Dataset Images*

5. *all_data.jpeg*  
   - *Description*: A snapshot of the custom-collected dataset used for training and testing the Seat Belt Detection model. The dataset contains a variety of images to help the model generalize to different environments and scenarios.

6. *seatauc1 (2).jpg*  
   - *Description*: Image showing a detected seat belt in the input image. The seat belt is identified and highlighted by the model's bounding box.

7. *seatbeltimage (1).jpeg*  
   - *Description*: Cropped region containing only the seat belt area, which is fed to the YOLO model for detection. This helps the model focus on the relevant part of the image, improving detection accuracy.

8. *seatbletdetection (1).jpeg*  
   - *Description*: Image after the YOLO model inference, showing the seat belt detection results with a bounding box around the detected seat belt. This image demonstrates the effectiveness of the trained model.

9. *windshield (1).jpeg*  
   - *Description*: Cropped region of the windshield area, which is used for windshield-related tasks in the project. The model can be trained or fine-tuned to detect windshields in vehicles for further safety feature analysis.

### *Process and Flow Diagrams*

10. *processflow.png*  
    - *Description*: A flowchart or diagram outlining the entire detection pipeline, from data preprocessing and training to inference and result analysis. This diagram helps visualize the steps involved in the project.

### *How to Use These Images*

1. *Model and Architecture Images*:  
   - These diagrams are primarily used for understanding and referencing the model architectures, both the default YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and the modified YOLOv8 architecture used in the project.

2. *Detection and Dataset Images*:  
   - These images can be referenced to understand how data is preprocessed (e.g., cropping regions for seat belt and windshield detection), as well as how the model performs during inference. The detection images (seatauc1 (2).jpg, seatbletdetection (1).jpeg) show real examples of the model's output.

3. *Process Flow Diagram*:  
   - The processflow.png provides a high-level view of the end-to-end pipeline for the Seat Belt Detection task. Itâ€™s useful for understanding the entire process and identifying where optimizations or improvements can be made.
